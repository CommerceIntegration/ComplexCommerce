This site is set up to run under IIS Express. IIS Express is a light-weight web server used
for development purposes that can run side by side with IIS 5.x and IIS 7.x so if you have
either of those configured it will be no problem.

You can add this site to your by setting up the following configuration section under 
%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\IISExpress\config\applicationhost.config

<site name="ComplexCommerce" id="9999999991">
    <application path="/" applicationPool="Clr4IntegratedAppPool">
        <virtualDirectory path="/" physicalPath="C:\Path\To\Application\Root" />
    </application>
    <bindings>
        <binding protocol="http" bindingInformation="*:51109:www.easyabcstore.com" />
    </bindings>
</site>
<applicationDefaults applicationPool="Clr4IntegratedAppPool" />

Note this example assumes you have an application pool configured named ASP.NET v4.0. 
If not, add an application pool with this name that runs under .NET v4 in Integrated Mode.
